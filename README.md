Collapse Accordion React Project



Welcome to the Collapse Accordion React project! This small project is designed to help you learn about state management in React by implementing a simple collapse accordion UI component.



Overview
The Collapse Accordion React project demonstrates how to create a collapsible accordion component using React's state management. When a user clicks on an accordion item, it expands to reveal its content, while the previously expanded item collapses. This project is perfect for beginners who want to understand the basics of state management in React.


Features
Simple UI: Provides a straightforward UI with collapsible accordion items.
State Management: Demonstrates how to manage component state to toggle the visibility of accordion items.
Easy to Understand: Designed for beginners with clear and concise code comments.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
